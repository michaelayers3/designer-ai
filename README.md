# Designer AI

## Description
As a User, I want to be able to have a website wireframe generated for me based on my inputs. I want to be able to save, view, and edit these wireframes to then use on personal websites that I create.

## Website Landing Page

## Usage
Sign up for an account and create/edit/delete wireframes. The user is able to fill out the form in 'Create Your Design'. Once submitted, through the api of OpenAI, a wireframe will be generated. The user can view the code live and edit accordingly. The html code is saved it the database for the user to then take as starter code for their website.
